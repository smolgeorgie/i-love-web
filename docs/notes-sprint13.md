# RECAP YEAR 1

## Node.js Recap

*Node.js*: A JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It's used to build server-side applications.
*Server-side rendering (SSR)*: A technique where the server generates the HTML content of a web page before sending it to the client, improving initial page load performance and SEO.

## Directus

*Headless CMS*: A content management system that focuses on managing content and data, without providing a built-in frontend.
*Models*: Data structures that define the organization and relationships between different data types.


# WHAT TO EXPECT YEAR 2

## **SvelteKit**

*Svelte*: A component-based framework for building user interfaces, known for its efficient compilation process.
*SvelteKit*: A full-stack framework built on Svelte, providing features like server-side rendering, code splitting, and routing.
*Hydration*: The process of transforming static HTML generated by the server into an interactive Svelte application on the client side.
*SSR-only mode*: A configuration where SvelteKit only renders the initial page on the server, and subsequent interactions are handled entirely on the client.

## Imporant information for whats coming 

### **Hosting**: 
We're using Vercel or Netlify for hosting our application. These platforms offer convenient deployment and management features.

### **Project Structure**: 
*Static folder*: Similar to the public folder in EJS, this folder contains static assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript files.
*Src folder*: The main development directory where our application's code resides.
app.html: The main HTML file for the application. You can customize it for specific needs like adding global styles or meta tags.

### **SvelteKit Features**: 
*Data-sveltekit-preload-data="hover"*: This attribute preloads the content of a linked page when the user hovers over the link, improving the user experience on desktop devices.

### **Code Organization**: 
*lib folder*: A dedicated folder for storing reusable components, promoting code organization and reusability.

### **Additional Notes**:
*Server-side rendering (SSR)*: We're starting without SSR for simplicity, but we can add it later if needed for performance or SEO benefits.
*Component-based development*: SvelteKit encourages a component-based approach, making it easier to build modular and maintainable applications.

# FIGMA WORKSHOPS - KILL YOUR DARLINGS

## **Tips for Figma - How to start**

* Make screenshots from designs you like and put them in your Figma file as reference. You can use LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, or Dribble for inspiration. 
* Make sketches that you can use as a base for your design. You can implement things from your screenshots for new ideas or featuers. 
* Create an assets folder in Figma where you can store all your icons, images, and other assets. This way, you can easily reuse them in your designs.

## **Tips and Tricks**

* Do not use too many different fonts. Stick to 2-3 fonts for your design.
* Line height is really important. Use 120% or 1.2em for a good line height.
* Use the same spacing between elements. This will make your design look more consistent.
* Use the same colors for the same elements. For example, use the same color for all buttons. Make some variations, but keep the same color scheme. 

# CREATIVE CODING WITH SVELTEKIT - JUSTUS

creative coding = progressive enhancement = content first - content = html, server side rendering.

## **Creative Coding**

*scroll-snap-type*: x-mandatory; locks scrolling horizontally, ensuring content snaps to predefined positions. This is a non-breaking enhancement. If someone has a browser that doesn't support this, they can still scroll normally, but they won't have the scroll snap effect.

**Tip**: 
* Be sure to check the SvelteKit documentation, as not everything works the same way in SvelteKit as in plain CSS!
* Documents don't exist in SvelteKit (on the server-side, JS). Use the onMount function on the client-side for this.


## **CSS properties**: 

ul { scroll-snap-type: x mandatory; }
ul li { scroll-snap-align: center; }

@supports (animation-timeline: scroll ()) {
ul li {
view-timeline-name:
view-timelines-axis:
view-timeline-inset:
animation-range: ]
