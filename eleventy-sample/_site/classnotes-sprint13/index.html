<h1>RECAP YEAR 1</h1>
<h2>Node.js Recap</h2>
<p><em>Node.js</em>: A JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It's used to build server-side applications.
<em>Server-side rendering (SSR)</em>: A technique where the server generates the HTML content of a web page before sending it to the client, improving initial page load performance and SEO.</p>
<h2>Directus</h2>
<p><em>Headless CMS</em>: A content management system that focuses on managing content and data, without providing a built-in frontend.
<em>Models</em>: Data structures that define the organization and relationships between different data types.</p>
<h1>WHAT TO EXPECT YEAR 2</h1>
<h2><strong>SvelteKit</strong></h2>
<p><em>Svelte</em>: A component-based framework for building user interfaces, known for its efficient compilation process.
<em>SvelteKit</em>: A full-stack framework built on Svelte, providing features like server-side rendering, code splitting, and routing.
<em>Hydration</em>: The process of transforming static HTML generated by the server into an interactive Svelte application on the client side.
<em>SSR-only mode</em>: A configuration where SvelteKit only renders the initial page on the server, and subsequent interactions are handled entirely on the client.</p>
<h2>Imporant information for whats coming</h2>
<h3><strong>Hosting</strong>:</h3>
<p>We're using Vercel or Netlify for hosting our application. These platforms offer convenient deployment and management features.</p>
<h3><strong>Project Structure</strong>:</h3>
<p><strong>Static folder</strong>: Similar to the public folder in EJS, this folder contains static assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript files.
<strong>Src folder</strong>: The main development directory where our application's code resides.
app.html: The main HTML file for the application. You can customize it for specific needs like adding global styles or meta tags.</p>
<h3><strong>SvelteKit Features</strong>:</h3>
<p><strong>Data-sveltekit-preload-data=&quot;hover&quot;</strong>: This attribute preloads the content of a linked page when the user hovers over the link, improving the user experience on desktop devices.</p>
<h3><strong>Code Organization</strong>:</h3>
<p><strong>lib folder</strong>: A dedicated folder for storing reusable components, promoting code organization and reusability.</p>
<h3><strong>Additional Notes</strong>:</h3>
<p><strong>Server-side rendering (SSR)</strong>: We're starting without SSR for simplicity, but we can add it later if needed for performance or SEO benefits.
<strong>Component-based development</strong>: SvelteKit encourages a component-based approach, making it easier to build modular and maintainable applications.</p>

<h1>FIGMA WORKSHOPS - KILL YOUR DARLINGS</h1>
<h2><strong>Tips for Figma - How to start</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Make screenshots from designs you like and put them in your Figma file as reference. You can use LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, or Dribble for inspiration.</li>
<li>Make sketches that you can use as a base for your design. You can implement things from your screenshots for new ideas or featuers.</li>
<li>Create an assets folder in Figma where you can store all your icons, images, and other assets. This way, you can easily reuse them in your designs.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Tips and Tricks</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Do not use too many different fonts. Stick to 2-3 fonts for your design.</li>
<li>Line height is really important. Use 120% or 1.2em for a good line height.</li>
<li>Use the same spacing between elements. This will make your design look more consistent.</li>
<li>Use the same colors for the same elements. For example, use the same color for all buttons. Make some variations, but keep the same color scheme.</li>
</ul>
<h1>CREATIVE CODING WITH SVELTEKIT - JUSTUS</h1>
<p>creative coding = progressive enhancement = content first - content = html, server side rendering.</p>
<h2><strong>Creative Coding</strong></h2>
<p><strong>scroll-snap-type</strong>: x-mandatory; locks scrolling horizontally, ensuring content snaps to predefined positions. This is a non-breaking enhancement. If someone has a browser that doesn't support this, they can still scroll normally, but they won't have the scroll snap effect.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to check the SvelteKit documentation, as not everything works the same way in SvelteKit as in plain CSS!</li>
<li>Documents don't exist in SvelteKit (on the server-side, JS). Use the onMount function on the client-side for this.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>CSS properties</strong>:</h2>
<pre><code>ul { scroll-snap-type: x mandatory; }
ul li { scroll-snap-align: center; }```
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-css">@supports (animation-timeline: scroll()) {
  ul li {
    view-timeline-name: &quot;My Timeline&quot;;
    view-timelines-axis: horizontal;
    view-timeline-inset: 20px;
    animation-range: 0s to 10s;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>==Do the SvelteKit tutorial. <code>-csr = false</code> turns off Client Side Rendering i.o.w Turns JavaScript off==</p>
<h1>WORKING TOGETHER, PRIORITIES AND TIME MANAGEMENT</h1>
<h2><strong>Epics</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Large, overarching work packages that represent a significant goal.Purpose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Break down work into manageable chunks.</li>
<li>Deliver value to customers regularly.</li>
<li>Keep teams focused on a larger goal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch a new e-commerce website.</li>
<li>Improve an existing website.</li>
<li>Implement augmented reality.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Stories</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Smaller, more specific work packages that are part of an Epic.Purpose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Further break down Epics into more concrete tasks.</li>
<li>Better plan and estimate work.Examples:</li>
<li>Add a shopping cart to an e-commerce website.</li>
<li>Make a website faster.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>User Stories</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Descriptions of a feature from the end-user's perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make requirements more concrete.</li>
<li>Ensure development stays focused on user needs.<strong>Format</strong>: As a [type of user], I want [goal], so that [reason]. <strong>Example</strong>: As a visitor, I want to be able to add products to my shopping cart, so that I can keep track of my purchases.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Relationship between Epics, Stories, and User Stories</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Epic → Stories</strong>: An Epic is broken down into multiple Stories.
<strong>Story → User Stories</strong> : A Story can be further elaborated into multiple User Stories.</p>
<h2><strong>Example: Adding a Shopping Cart</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Epic</strong>: Launch a new e-commerce website.<br>
<strong>Story</strong>: Add a shopping cart.
<strong><li>User Stories:</li></strong></p>
<ul><li> As a visitor, I want to be able to add products to my shopping cart.</li>
<li>As a visitor, I want to be able to remove products from my shopping cart.</li>
... 
</ul>
<br>
<li>Tasks:</li>
<ul> <li> Create a database for the shopping cart.</li>
<li> Design the shopping cart interface.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Planning Poker for time estimation</strong></h2>
<p>Consensus-based technique for estimating the effort required to complete a task. Planning Poker involves team members selecting a card that represents their estimate of the task's complexity. The team then discusses the estimates and repeats the process until a consensus is reached. This can variate per number, like 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 24, 40 etc.</p>
<h2>** Prioritization Techniques**</h2>
<p><strong>MoSCoW Method</strong>: Prioritizes tasks based on their importance and urgency. Tasks are categorized as Must-haves, Should-haves, Could-haves, and Won't-haves.</p>
<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>By using Epics, Stories, and User Stories, teams can approach large projects in a structured and efficient manner. This approach ensures that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of what needs to be done and why.</p>
